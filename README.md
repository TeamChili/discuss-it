### Walkthrough

We throw ourselves on the road ideally on Friday/Saturday before 2pm.. We drive about less than 2 hours and arrive at the cable car station at Maurach beside the Lake Achensee. 

Our cars can be parked at the station and we divide into two groups and reach the Maurach top in two different ways: by cable car and by feet. 

We will stay at ErfurterHuette overnight, so lucky ones that take the cable car could already drop your stuff in the room and prepare yourself by drink some fresh beers and walk around the top. We should be all together at the top before sunset which will be at 9pm.

We then get wasted in the night...

The next day get up in the morning or at noon depending how wasted we are. We can spend a bit time on the top and slowly walk down, it should not take more 2 hours downhill. After that we can either walk a bit along the beautiful Achensee and drive home in the afternoon.
